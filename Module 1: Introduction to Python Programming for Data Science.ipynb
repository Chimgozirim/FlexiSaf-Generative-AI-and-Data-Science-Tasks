# First task for Flexisaff Gen Ai/ Machine Learning Engineering internship.
* Create a Python program that simulates a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors between the user and the computer. The program must Define the possible choices, Get the user's choice, Generate a random choice for the computer, Determine the winner based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

    return options

    user_choice = while_loop_activator # This is just so the while loop has an existing condition to evaluate and run on.
    
    while user_choice not in options:
        #Possible user choice. Must be one of the values in the options.
        user_choice = input(f"Please enter your choice. Choose from one of the options in the brackets ({', '.join(options)})").lower()
        if user_choice not in options:
            print(f'Invalid choice. Please select any of these {", ".join(options)}')

    return user_choice

        and selects one option at random each time the function is called
    '''
    return random.choice(options)

def rules(your_choice, system_choice):
    '''
    This function defines the game rules
    and determines the winner bases on the user input and
    the randomly selected computer choice. It does this using
    some defined condition, then returns a meesage that tells 
    the ouitcome of the game.
    '''
    
    if your_choice == system_choice:

        or (your_choice == 'paper' and system_choice == 'rock'):
        print("You win!!")
    else:
        print("Computer wins!")

    This is the function that runs the game when called.
    It does this by defining the arguments for the rule() function,
