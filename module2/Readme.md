# Module 2: Foundational Statistics and Probability

### Probability Fundamentals:
+ Basic definitions: sample space, events, and outcomes.
* Probability Rules: Addition and Multiplication Rule
- Conditional Probability  
* Independence

### Descriptive Statistics:                                                                                                      * Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode.Measures of Variability: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation.
* Measures of Variability: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation: Square root of the variance.

### Probability Distributions:
* Discrete Distributions: Probability Mass Function (PMF), Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF).
* Continuous Distributions: Probability Density Function (PDF), Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF).

### Statistical Inference:
* Sampling and Sampling Distributions: Population, Sample, Sampling Distribution.
* Estimation: Point Estimation, Interval Estimation
* Hypothesis Testing: Null Hypothesis (H0), Alternative Hypothesis (H1), Significance Level (Î±), P-value.

### Regression and Correlation:
* Correlation                                                                   
* Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression.

## **TASK**

### Analyze a small, publicly available dataset using Python's NumPy or Pandas libraries.                                                                                                
1. Explore the data:

Print the first few rows using data.head().
Check the data types of each column using data.info().
Get summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) using data.describe().

2. Calculate basic statistics:

Calculate the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for each numerical feature.
Calculate the correlation between different features using data.corr().
