    "* Total Produced has a mean of 53.8 K units and a median of 53.4 K, with a standard deviation of 26.1 K. The proximity of mean and median suggests a roughly symmetric distribution around 53 K, though there is considerable spread (+- 26 K).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Total Sold shows a lower central tendency (mean 29.3 K, median 22.3 K) and a substantial spread (21.6 K). Because the mean (29.3 K) exceeds the median (22.3 K) by 7 K, sales volumes are right-skewed—i.e., a subset of high-volume SKUs pulls the average upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Damaged units average 12.6 K per SKUs, with a median of 7.99 K and Std = 13.9 K. The fact that the mean (12.6 K) is substantially larger than the median (8.0 K) indicates a right skew: most SKUs incur fewer than 8 K damaged units, but a minority suffer very large damage counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unsold Inventory has mean 11.8 K and median 6.65 K, with Std = 13.4 K. Again, mean > median implies right skew—some SKUs hold unusually large unsold backlogs.\n",

    "* The combination of damage, sold, and unsold counts shows that, on average, about 53.8 K units are produced per SKU, of which 29.3 K are sold, 12.6 K are damaged, and ~11.8 K remain unsold.\n",

    "* Sell-Through Rate (i.e., sold \\ \\[released]) averages 55.95% (median 56.49%) with Std = 25.77%. The mean and median are nearly equal, indicating a fairly symmetric distribution of rates around 56 %. The large standard deviation (+- 25.8 percentage points) shows wide variation—some SKUs sell nearly 100%, others sell very little.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Damage Rate averages 22.41% (median 17.68%) with Std = 19.46%. Here the mean exceeds the median by 4.7 points, signifying a right-skewed distribution: most SKUs have < 18% damage, but a tail of SKUs sees much higher rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Price per unit has mean \\$86.00, median \\\\$82.50, and Std = \\\\$23.02. Since the mean is slightly higher than the median, there are some higher-priced SKUs pulling the average upward, but overall prices cluster in the \\\\$60–\\\\$110 range.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Estimated Revenue (presumably price × sold) averages \\\\$2.495 million, median $\\\\1.864 million, with Std = $1.971 million. The mean > median implies right skew: a small number of very high-revenue SKUs drive up the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In summary, most SKUs cluster near the medians: ~53 K produced, ~22 K sold, ~8 K damaged, ~6.6 K unsold, ~56% sell‐through, ~18% damage, and a \\\\$82.50–\\\\$86 price range. However, wide standard deviations and mean > median patterns highlight that a minority of SKUs with very large volumes, high damage, or high revenue create a pronounced right‐tail effect in nearly every metric.\n",
