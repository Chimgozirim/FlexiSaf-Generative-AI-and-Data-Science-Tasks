This selection is done simultaneously and not one after the other, this is so the other player doesn't make a better choice based on their opponent's choice.\n",

    "When people play this game, they use their hands to make their selection. Each player will shake one of their hands in front of the other, recite a short song and then show either Two with Index and middle fingers (Scissors), Five with all fingers(Paper) or Zero by folding all fingers(Rock).\n",
